# Minikube-WebApp-MongoDB
This repository is for my first kubernetes project, in which i created a ConfigMap for mongoDb endpoint, Secret for username and password for authentication. I have created a deployment and services for both mongodb and webApp. and finaly created an external service for webapp so that it should be accessible through web (Chrome)
